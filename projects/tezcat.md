Tezcat is a short dungeon crawler game that challenges players to navigate procedurally generated floors in search of treasures while avoiding enemies. Each playthrough offers a unique experience as the procedurally generated levels ensure that no two runs are the same. The game’s fast-paced mechanics and unpredictable layouts keep players on their toes and also tests the player's daringness, they can steal more treasures, but that, as a result, makes them slower and the enemies harder to evade. The core gameplay revolves around exploration and risk management. Players must decide whether to delve deeper into the dungeon for greater rewards or play it safe to avoid the increasing dangers lurking on each floor.

As a member of the development team for Tezcat, I was responsible for implementing the game’s graphics as well as several smaller mechanics, such as the pause screen. Trying to match graphics with procedurally generated rooms is a challenging task that required collaboration with the members who implemented the procedural generation code. Ensuring that the graphics remain function for all types of rooms. In addition, I implemented the pause screen and other utility mechanics, these provides to enhance the player's controls, making the game's experience more fluid and intuitive.

Working on Tezcat gave me a deeper understanding of game graphics and the importance of cohesive visual design. I improved my skills in integrating assets into a game engine as well as collaborating with different sections of code. Collaborating with my team also taught me the importance of balancing artistic vision with technical constraints, it was very difficult using limited graphics for those implementations. In addition, the team also collaborated in quality assurance and testing. This project strengthened my ability to contribute to both the creative and functional aspects of game development, leaving me better prepared for future projects in the field.
