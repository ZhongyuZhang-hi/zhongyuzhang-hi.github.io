Rusted Heart is a Unity-based game developed collaboratively by the Gamedev Club at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The game tells the story of a robot who embarks on an adventure to save their sister, whose heart is failing. Players engage in exciting rhythm-based combat mechanics while exploring an immersive world.

I was responsible for implementing the map and dialogue systems in the game. The maps guided the player's movements, while the dialogue system facilitated story progression and character interactions. By designing these components, I ensured that the gameplay and player interactions felt engaging, supporting the overall narrative of the game.

This project taught me valuable lessons in collaboration and technical implementation. I deepened my understanding of Unity's tools, including collisions, different types of hitboxes for different interactions, UI systems, as well as designing reusable scripts. Additionally, I enhanced my ability to communicate and work as part of a team, aligning and collaborating with other members to create one cohesive project.
