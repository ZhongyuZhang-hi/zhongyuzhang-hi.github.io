## 1. How did you make your effort estimates?

I divided my effort estimates into two main categories: coding and non-coding. For non-coding tasks. We simply had to more a lot of guesswork and in the end, it was not very useful. Coding tasks, however, were much more diverse and measurable, so they were further split into UI and Database components.

For UI-related tasks, I based my estimates on the scope of visual changes. Early in the project, I often overestimated because UI work typically involves fine-tuning and visual polish. As we progressed, this became easier to estimate due to increased component reusability. For example, on the admin page, we reused the post card component, resizing and slightly redesigning it. The initial version took time to get right, especially with layout and text slicing, but the second version was a quick adaptation. So, when estimating the time to implement listing and deleting posts or clubs in the Admin page, I assumed the Clubs feature would be simpler from a UI standpoint. However, in practice, it turned out to be more complex for other reasons unrelated to the interface.

For Database tasks, estimation was more difficult. Our evolving design often introduced new features that required database restructuring, creating cascading impacts. These late-stage changes became harder to scope, especially as the system grew more interconnected. Initially, I added Posts as a prototype and estimated the work at around 30 minutes, based on our experience with similar tasks from assignments and WODs. But as I added functionality—like filtering and finding posts—the complexity increased significantly. Each new feature required thorough testing, and the cumulative effect extended development time. Although we later estimated the full Post system would take about 2 hours, unforeseen bugs and technical challenges caused it to exceed that estimate.

## 2. Even though your estimates were always off, sometimes way off, was there any benefit from making effort estimates for the issues in advance? If so, what benefits? If not, why not?

Personally, during this project, I didn’t find the effort estimates particularly helpful. This was mainly due to the way we worked, our general approach was to do “as much as we could” rather than plan tasks around specific time limits. We didn’t really track hours or stick to strict schedules; instead, we worked on a task until it was done or until we needed assistance, then moved on to the next.

Effort estimation might have been more useful if we had structured our time more formally: such as setting designated work periods or tracking progress in hourly blocks. In a professional setting where compensation or deadlines are more rigid, having accurate estimates would definitely be more critical. In our case, the estimates were mostly casual guesses based on personal understanding and experience. As the project went on and our estimates proved consistently inaccurate, we started treating them more like rough guesses rather than reliable tools.

## 3. Was there any benefit for tracking the actual effort expended on the issues? If so, what benefits? If not, why not? Was there any downside to estimating and tracking your effort? If so what?

Yes, there was definitely a benefit to tracking the actual effort we spent on tasks. It helped us identify which types of tasks were more time-consuming and why. For example, once we knew how long it took to build a page for creating posts, we could use that as a reference for similar features, like building a page for submitting feedback.

Aside from the extra time we lost navigating Vercel due to our inexperience, by basing it off making posts, we correctly weigh the actual process of making the feedback page to be around 30 minutes, similar to the add-contact assignment from earlier in the semester. Because we tracked our effort, we were able to budget extra time for potential errors or troubleshooting, which made planning easier.

Overall, tracking actual effort was helpful because it gave us a better understanding of what to expect when working on similar tasks. As for downsides, the only issue was that inaccurate estimates sometimes made the tracking feel less useful in the moment, but in hindsight, it was still valuable for learning and improving future planning. Additionally, I believed it could be much more helpful if we were more organized when creating this project.

## 4. How did you track your actual effort? How accurate do you believe your tracking was?

We tracked our actual effort by noting the start and end times while working on specific issues. If we took a break, we’d pause the timer and resume tracking when we got back to work. In terms of measuring time spent, I believe our tracking was fairly accurate.

However, when it came to categorizing the effort, such as separating coding from non-coding tasks, the tracking was less precise. We didn’t establish a clear standard for what counted as coding versus non-coding. Aside from obvious non-coding tasks like design discussions or asking others to test pages, almost everything felt like a coding task, which made it hard to break things down meaningfully. Honestly, from that perspective, our tracking wasn’t very consistent, and we mostly ended up guessing how much of the time fell into each category.

## 5. How much overhead was there in tracking your effort? Did it take up a noticeable amount of time or inhibit you working on the project?

Since we didn’t find effort tracking particularly useful during the project, we didn’t spend much time or energy on it. Our estimates were often based on similar tasks we had done before, either in this project or in past assignments, so we just used those as rough references. Tracking actual times were even simplier, it was just using a timer, taking close to no effort at all. So tracking/estimating did not inhibit the project at all.

Even if we had put more effort into tracking and estimating, I don’t think it would have significantly slowed us down. The time spent estimating is minimal compared to the time it takes to actually complete a task. And as we gained more experience, we became better at identifying useful factors for estimating, such as the scale of the change, the number of affected files, the complexity of the feature, and potential integration issues. In future projects, I believe that we could track/estimate time much better and incorporate it into our system effectively.
