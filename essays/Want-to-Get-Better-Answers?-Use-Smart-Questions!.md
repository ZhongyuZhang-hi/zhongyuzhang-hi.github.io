*"A prudent question is one-half of wisdom."* – Francis Bacon

## Why Smart Questions

A smart question is the most effective way to gain knowledge about something that isn’t easily learned. It is an essential skill in both problem-solving and learning. In Eric Raymond’s How to Ask Questions the Smart Way, he emphasizes that well-structured questions are more likely to receive helpful and insightful answers. Asking a question is more than just requesting information, it requires effort, clarity, and structure. To explore this concept, let's examine two questions posted on Stack Overflow: one that exemplifies a well-asked question and another that demonstrates poor question-asking practices.

## Experiences I Want to gain and Develop

An example of a smart question is titled, <a href="[https://uhmanoagamedev.itch.io/rusted-heart](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6841333/why-is-subtracting-these-two-epoch-milli-times-in-year-1927-giving-a-strange-r)"><i class="large github icon "></i>"Why is subtracting these two epoch-milli Times (in year 1927) giving a strange result?" </a>
The user presents a concise yet descriptive title that immediately captures the essence of the issue. Giving many details such as the test case ‘"1927-12-31 23:54:08" - “1927-12-31 23:54:07", with an expected output of “1”, and the actual output “353”. And how shifting the time 1 second forward would give the expected time normally. Along with the most important code snippets that could impact the result.


## The Future

In conclusion, I’m eager to continue learning and growing as a software engineer, with a particular focus on game development. I’m excited by the opportunities to hone my technical skills, collaborate effectively in teams, and develop immersive systems that seamlessly blend logic and creativity. Software engineering isn’t just about solving problems; it’s about crafting tools and experiences that can leave a lasting impact. By continuing to explore new areas of knowledge and challenging myself through collaborative projects, I hope to build a career that is both fulfilling and impactful.
