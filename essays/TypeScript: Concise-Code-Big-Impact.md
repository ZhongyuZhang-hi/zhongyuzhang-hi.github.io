# A New Experience
I was just introduced to typescripts over the last week. One unique thing I’ve noticed is its flexibility, such as with allowing multiple return types. This stands out when compared to languages I’ve worked with before like Java and C. However, I do feel a bit overwhelmed by the sheer amount of content and scripting options. The flexibility in TypeScript is exciting, but I’m still adapting, especially with how typescripts basic data type and how typescripts declare and modify arrays. I find myself having a hard time comprehending new materials and concepts while still struggling with those simple things. However, I am confident that I’ll adapt and understand with more experience and application.

# Concise Yet Challenging
For example, one particular part I found confusing was with the rest operators. (...arr)
```
const [a, b, ...arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7];
console.log(a, b);
console.log(arr);
```
*log:
10
20
[3, 4, 5, 7]*

This one line of code is able to declare a new array as well assigning multiple variables. It’s a very impressive and concise way of coding. However, the information that they provide is less than what I was used to when using indexes and subarrays, and that caused me to have some struggles in understanding what the rest operator code was doing and trying to learn and apply it for myself. One comparison I can make is between typescripts and Chinese writing. Like typescript operations, a single Chinese character contains a lot of information, but in exchange, each Chinese character is unique to write. I feel that while typescripts will be hard to learn, the reward and benefits from using it is also going to be very rewarding.

# Learning Through WODs
Additionally, I’ve developed a strong appreciation for the athletic software engineering approach. The practice WODs provide a great opportunity to apply what we’ve learned, during the week or during any previous materials. I particularly appreciate the video solution that comes with the practice WODs which also include the entire process and line of thinking. Going from how to approach the problem and breaking the problem down to pieces. Depending on the material covered, some WODs can feel stressful, but with sufficient resources available before and during the exercise, I find them to be enjoyable. I enjoy the experience of breaking down problems and solving them, putting emphasis on the lines of thinking to get to solutions rather than struggling to recall syntax or function names. You can focus on figuring out the problem rather than trying to bring out code syntaxes from your head. Overall, I believe this approach is an efficient and effective way of learning as well as a method to provide a measure of understanding of the content.
